# Transactions Quick Start Guide

## How Transactions Work in Admin Panel

### 🎯 Key Concept

**Transactions** track payment activities separately from orders. One order can have multiple transactions:

- Full refunds
- Chargebacks

### 📍 Where to Find Transactions

#### 1. **In Order Details (Order Modal)**
- Go to **Orders** page
- Click 👁️ icon on any order
- Scroll to **"Payment Transactions"** section
- See all transactions for that order

#### 2. **Dedicated Transactions Page**
- Click **"Transactions"** in sidebar
- Or go to `/transactions`
- View all transactions across all orders
- Filter by status, type, order ID, etc.

#### 3. **From Orders Table**
- Click 💲 icon next to any order
- Opens Transactions page filtered by that order ID
